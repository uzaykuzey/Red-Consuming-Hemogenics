	<description>Adds a special gene that lets hemogenic pawns fill their hemogen by consuming the color of red items. Perfect for pacifist colonies that also contains hemogenic pawns. Similar to the vampires and Marceline in Adventure Time.

Features:

Red Consumer Gene:
A Gene that allows a hemogenic pawn to gain the Consume Red ability. Has 1 complexity and -1 metabolic efficiency.

Consume Red:
An ability that allows a pawn to gain hemogen by consuming red items. The amount of the hemogen gained is determined by the weight of the item, and it can be changed in mod settings. The consumed items get destroyed.

Red Consumer Gene Implanter:
A rare artifact that can be used to give a hemogenic pawn the red consumer gene.

Pacifist Hemogenics Precept:
A precept that punishes pawns for consuming blood and rewards them for consuming red items. If Ideology is enabled, it can be used to increase the roleplay depth.

This is my first Rimworld mod, so please feel free to report bugs!
